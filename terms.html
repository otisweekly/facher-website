        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to FACH. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the FACH mobile application ("App") and related services. By using FACH, you agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using FACH, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>FACH is a collection cataloging application that allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scan and identify books, vinyl records, magazines, art, and other collectibles</li>
            <li>Organize and manage your collection</li>
            <li>Track item details, condition, and value</li>
            <li>Sync your collection across devices (with an account)</li>
            <li>Export and backup your collection data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>You may use FACH without creating an account, with data stored locally on your device. To enable cloud sync and backup, you must create an account using Apple Sign-In, Google Sign-In, email, or phone number.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials</li>
            <li>All activities that occur under your account</li>
            <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App for any illegal purpose</li>
            <li>Upload content that infringes on intellectual property rights</li>
            <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App's functionality</li>
            <li>Use automated systems to access the App without permission</li>
            <li>Share your account credentials with others</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. User Content</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of any content you add to your collection (photos, notes, etc.). By using the App, you grant us a limited license to process and store this content solely to provide our services to you.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to upload any content you add to the App.</p>

        <h2>6. AI-Powered Features</h2>
        <p>FACH uses artificial intelligence to identify items from photos. While we strive for accuracy, AI identification may sometimes be incorrect. You should verify important information independently.</p>
        <p>Images submitted for AI identification are processed but not permanently stored by our AI providers.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>FACH integrates with third-party services (Discogs, Open Library, etc.) to provide metadata. These services have their own terms of use. We are not responsible for the accuracy or availability of third-party data.</p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The FACH App, including its design, features, and content, is owned by us and protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, or distribute any part of the App without our permission.</p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>
        <p>We do not guarantee the accuracy of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AI-powered item identification</li>
            <li>Pricing or value estimates</li>
            <li>Third-party metadata</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP.</p>
        <p>Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve months preceding the claim.</p>

        <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms. We will notify you of material changes through the App or by email.</p>

        <h2>13. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, you may export your data using the in-app export feature.</p>
